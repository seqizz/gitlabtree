GitLab code tree view (embed in sidebar fork)
=====================

**Note: This is just a fork, created just to be able to use empty sidebar which original extension didn't use.**
**Original work of Tomáš Bončo can be found in [here](https://github.com/tomasbonco/gitlabtree)**

This is browser extension for Chrome / Firefox / Opera (and maybe IE as well :) ) that provides tree view for code in GitLab (must have for code reviews!).
